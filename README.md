# CROWD
opening scene
I use an Asset Mesh Animator to spawn the crowd (has a problem, not all Animator animations work ...)
And I also use MicControl 3 to use the helmet's microphone as input:
When the user exhales through the mouth, the microphone captures the sound and performs 2 actions:
turn down the volume on every sound you capture
remove characters from the crowd, actually remove instances
