# CROWD
Opening scene
I use an Asset Mesh Animator to spawn the crowd (but has a problem, not all Animator animations are working ...)
Also, I use MicControl 3 to use the helmet's microphone as input:
When the user exhales through the mouth, the microphone captures the sound and performs 2 actions:
1.turn down the volume on every sound capture it
2. removes characters from the crowd, in fact remove instances. The problem is that I do not know how to make it more progressive ... 
I would like that on each exhalation (each time the microphone picks up the sound of breathing), the speed of movement of the characters is reduced, or that the animation changes from run to walk. The problem is, I don't really understand how the Asset I'm using to generate the crowd works.
